# Node-Periodic-Table

It will give you the data of a chemical element by name, symbol or number!

> **To Note:** Me and my team created the package. But the JSON Data of chemical elements which is took from an open source code by [https://github.com/Bowserinator](https://github.com/Bowserinator). We just made it available it as in NPM Package

# Quick Example
```js 
const npt = require('node-periodic-table')
```

Ways to get Info of an element
```js 
// By name
npt.getByName('Hydrogen')

// By number of the element in Periodic Table
npt.getByNumber(1)

// By chemical symbol of an element
npt.getBySymbol('H')

// By query
npt.getByQuery('Hydro')

// Get Version
npt.version
```

# Output
Output would be in JSON Form like this
```json

        "name": "Hydrogen",
